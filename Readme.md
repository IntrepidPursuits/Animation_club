# Animation Club

The Intrepid Animation Club provides an opportunity for developers to practice implementing custom animations while also sharing their animation knowledge with others. 

Every two weeks the Animation Club will pick a new animation and spend time individually working out a native version of the animation.

This repository includes a subdirectory for each selected animation. Each subdirectory includes a Readme.md file and asset folder. The Readme.md file includes a link to the Dribble page of the given animation, any additional required information, and a section where developers can add links to their personal repository that house their animation code. To include a link to your repository for a given animation just update the Readme.md file.
